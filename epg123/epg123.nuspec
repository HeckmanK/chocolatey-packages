    <summary>Media Center Electronic Program Guide in 1-2-3</summary>
    <description>
For many Windows Media Center TV users, July 2015 was not a good month. Microsoft changed their provider of guide data from the highly stable and reliable Zap2it (Tribune), to the almost amateurish Rovi (Rovi Corp). To be fair to Rovi, the data provided by them to Microsoft is probably fine, but the execution of the transfer and the continuing struggles has been amazingly disappointing.

EPG123 was created to not only compensate for the lacking guide information, but to also relieve the user from relying on Microsoft and/or Rovi to fill their guide with accurate information. The guide information downloaded by EPG123 is provided by Gracenote (Tribune) via servers maintained by [Schedules Direct](https://schedulesdirect.org). EPG123 delivers that highly stable and reliable data that is expected to even include some customization. Most importantly, though, it provides the user with some control over their own destiny for TV watching and recording.

## Note

This package will perform a default installation of EPG123. If an existing install is present, the installer will upgrade the current install.

## Package installation defaults

By default, **installation** of this package:

- Will perform a FULL INSTALL

However, **upgrades** to EPG123 via this package:

- Will upgrade the current installation

## Package Parameters

- `/TYPE=full` - Both Server and Client Files will be installed (Default)
- `/TYPE=server` - Only the Server Files will be installed
- `/TYPE=client` - Only the Client Files will be installed
- `/TYPE=custom` - Use COMPONENTS parameter to specify components to be installed (comma-separated)
- `/COMPONENTS="main1\epg123"` - Select the Scheduled Direct Component
- `/COMPONENTS="main1\hdhr"` - Select the SiliconDust Component
- `/COMPONENTS="main2\tray"` - Select the Notification Tray Tool (Client)
- `/TASKS=""` - The Desktop icon and start menu icons will not be installed
- `/TASKS="desktopicon"` - The Desktop icon will be installed
- `/NOICONS` - The Desktop icon will not be installed

These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
For example to install everything except the SiliconDust Component:
`choco install epg123 -params '"/TYPE=custom /COMPONENTS="main1\epg123,main2\tray""'`
To install the server files without a desktop icon:
`choco install epg123 -params '"/TYPE=server /NOICONS"'`
To install the client files:
`choco install epg123 -params '"/TYPE=client"'`
